# Security Go(lang) Testing

The files below are only used for our Go test framework for making sure the simulated vCenter Server (vcsim) is able to authenticate in a secure manner. The files don't actually access any valid resource anywhere. These files include:

- ca.key
- ca.pem
- server.csr
- server.key
- server.pem
- invalid.pem
