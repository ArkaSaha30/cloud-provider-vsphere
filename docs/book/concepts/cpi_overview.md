# Overview of the Cloud Provider Interface

The Cloud Provider Interface (CPI) project decouples intelligence of underlying cloud infrastructure features from the core Kubernetes project. The out-of-tree CPI provides Kubernetes with details about the infrastructure on which it has been deployed. When a Kubernetes node registers itself with the Kubernetes API server, it requests additional information about itself from the cloud provider. The CPI provides the node object in the Kubernetes cluster with its IP addresses and zone/region topology. When the node understands the topology and hierarchy of the underlying infrastructure, more intelligent application placement decisions can be made. See the [Cloud Provider Interface (CPI)](https://github.com/kubernetes/cloud-provider-vsphere/docs/book/cloud_provider_interface.md) for more details.

The out-of-tree CPI integration connects to vCenter Server and maps information about your infrastructure, such as VMs, disks, and so on, back to the Kubernetes API.  Only the cloud-controller-manager pod is required to have a valid config file and credentials to connect to vCenter Server. The following chapters offer more information on how to configure this provider. For now, assume that the cloud-controller-manager pod has access to the config file and credentials that allow access to vCenter Server. The following simplified diagram illustrates which components in your cluster should be connecting to vCenter Server.
